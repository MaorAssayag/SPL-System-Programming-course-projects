# The objectives in this course :

   * Learning how to create programs that interact with sophisticated Run-Time Environments (RTE). The key notion of the course is that programs are always created relative to another program - which we call the RTE. RTEs have a regular structure: they provide services that the programs we create exploit. In the course, we focus on 4 generic services: management of memory, management of concurrency, communication and networking, and persistent data management (file organization and database usage with SQL).

    * Across these topics, we compare various RTEs: Unix and Windows Operating Systems, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and on occasion, Servlet containers and distributed RTEs.

    * Gaining experience and exposure to good practices for mid-size programming. The course offers exposure for intensive hands-on programming in pairs. We will learn C++ as a new programming language and systematically compare it to Java. Our perspective is to explain how programming languages provide an abstraction layer above the facilities provided by the intended RTE in which programs are executed. We will focus on systematic acquisition of good programming habits: documentation of code, code metrics verification, design patterns examples, unit testing, test driven development.

   *  This aspect of the course is not theory driven, but instead, experience driven: we will work on 4 large programming assignments during the semester. 

* This course involves learning to work with new tools and environments, which often is intimidating. Part of the learning experience is to face these difficulties, not to avoid them or hide them. 

# File terminal
* The objective of this assignment is to design an object-oriented system and gain implementation experience in C++ while using classes, standard data structures and unique C++ properties such as the “Rule of 5”. We learn how to handle memory in C++ and avoid memory leaks.

#  ThreadPool- Universty registration system

* The goal of following assignment is to practice concurrent programming on Java 8 environment. This assignment requires a good understanding of Java Threads, Java Synchronization, Lambdas, and Callbacks. in addition this assigenment cover the following topics/tools : Json read&parse, Maven build,Concurrent DataBases, Junit test.
